# Tower_of_Hanoi_in_C

Wrote this game when I was bored in the midnight after studying for my data structures and algorithms exams for 3 days straight.

Please don't expect any optimization or error handling because I've hard coded my game as I was busy with my exams, also I made it from scratch.

This project was made as a fun experiment so to experiment with the Linked Lists Data Structures (Yes, implimentation of stacks using Linked Lists).

It was a fun challenge as I could understand the beauty of Linked Lists.

I might make this project again someday in future with GUI.
